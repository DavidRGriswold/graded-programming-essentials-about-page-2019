    <h1>Computer Programming Principles</h1>
    <h3>What will you do?</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Learn the basic principles of computer programming using Python, one of the most versatile and powerful
            computer languages around. Press the <img id="arrow" src="arrow.png""> button below to see a very simple Python program in action.

            </p>
        <li>Create applications to solve realistic problems</li>
        <li>Use professional programming tools, such as git, Integrated Development Environments, and professional
            coding editors</li>
        <li>Learn how computers "think,"" store their data, and interact with each other</li>
        <li>Learn about the major parts of a computer and how they interact</li>

    </ul>
    <h3>What do you need to know?</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>This course has no prerequisites. Come one, come all!</li>
        <li>This course will focus primarily on coding to <em>do things</em> and <em>solve problems</em>. If you are
            more interested in design and presentation, you should consider taking the Web Design course (or take both!)
        </li>
